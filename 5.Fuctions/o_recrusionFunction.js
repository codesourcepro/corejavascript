/**
 * Recursion Function in JavaScript
 * => Recursion is a programming pattern or concept embedded in many programming languages, and JavaScript is not left out. It is a feature used in creating a function that keeps calling itself but with a smaller input every consecutive time until the codeâ€™s desired result from the start is achieved.
 * => This tends to keep a very clean slate of codes while providing solutions to multiple tasks of similar structure. A function that operates on the concept of recursion is called a recursive function.
