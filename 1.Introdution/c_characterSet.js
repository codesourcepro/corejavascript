Character Set
=> A character set is the key component behind displaying, manipulating and editing text, numbers and symbols on a computer.
A character set is created through a process known as encoding i.e. each character is assigned with a unique code or value.

=> JavaScript programs are written using the Unicode character set. Unicode is a superset of ASCII and Latin-1 and supports virtually 
every written language currently used on the planet. ECMAScript 3 requires JavaScript implementations to support Unicode version 2.1 
or later, and ECMAScript 5 requires implementations to support Unicode 3 or later. See the sidebar in Text for more about Unicode and 
JavaScript.

=> All word and/or data processing applications are embedded with one or more character sets. The characters within a character set 
can be text, number or even symbols. Each character is represented by a number. ASCII characters set is one of the most popular 
character sets used by general computers to display text or numbers on computer screen. It represents uppercase and lower case 
English alphabets, number, mathematical operators and symbols from number 0â€“127.
